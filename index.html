                <p class="lead">Every year the NSA recruits top talent from colleges and universities across
                the country for internships and full time positions. They promise students the thrill of serving their country, being a
                part of something bigger than themselves, and the chance to work with the latest technology.</p>
                
                <p class="lead">Given recent leaks, the reality is much darker. Unfortunately, many students don't give enough thought
                to the nature of the NSA's work and the kind of activities they may either be directly, or indirectly, supporting. So if
                you're thinking about taking a position with the NSA, please consider the following.
